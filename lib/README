This directory is intended for project-specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them into static libraries and link them into the executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in its own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see the structure of the following two libraries: `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
| |
| |--Bar
| | |--docs
| | |--examples
| | |--src
| | |- Bar.c
| | |- Bar.h
| | |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) [link to documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html)
| |
| |--Foo
| | |- Foo.c
| | |- Foo.h
| |
| |--AutoWiFiConnect
| | |- AutoWiFiConnect.cpp
| | |- AutoWiFiConnect.h
| |
| |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
|- main.c

And the contents of `src/main.c`:
